# Fillit
## Project  to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.

*A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to
the popular game Tetris*

## The description of a Tetriminos respect the following rules:

* Precisely 4 lines of 4 characters, each followed by a new line (well... a 4x4 square).
* A Tetrimino is a classic piece of Tetris composed of 4 blocks.
* Each character is either a block character(’#’ ) or an empty character (’.’).
• Each block of a Tetrimino touch at least one other block on any of his 4 sides (up, down, left and right).

## The goal of this project is to arrange every Tetriminos with each others in order to make the smallest possible square, with  assigning a capital letter to eachTetrimino, starting with ’A’ and increasing for each new Tetrimino.
